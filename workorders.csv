To: The Avalon HOA/BOD,

As a follow-up to my question posed to the BOD at last night's BOD meeting (04/24/2025),  I’m writing to bring to your attention an issue with the hedges located along the Eastern perimeter of my residence at 7575 New Holland Way, but facing Oak Vista Way.

It appears that several feet of the hedges are dying or have already died due to the invasion of White Flies, which not only affects the overall appearance of our community but may also impact property values and the intended privacy or boundary they provide.

I understand that landscaping is typically managed by the HOA, so I wanted to inquire whether any plans are in place to address this issue. If not, I’d respectfully request that the board consider evaluating the health of these plants and arranging for replacement or appropriate treatment as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time and continued efforts in keeping our community looking great. Please let me know if any additional information or photos would be helpful.

Respectfully,,Joseph & Rona Canevari7575 New Holland Way703-975-6480
