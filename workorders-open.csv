1/17/2025,LK55987,Ken Levenbook,Patti Dennis,open,In Progress,Landscaping,"Replace dead tree along New Ellenton Drive.
The tree was replaced in the wrong place after a two year wait.  I was contacted while I was in New York City and was not here when the tree was planted in the root zone of another tree.  The attached pictures show that the tree should have been planted within three feet of the mailbox.  If the tree was planted when it was approved, two years ago, the proper place would have been evident. ", 
2/6/2025,CX52539,Joseph Luca,Andrea Berens,open,In Progress,Other,"The tree in front of my house has caused the concrete sidewalk to crack, which is a trip hazard to people walking by. The tree has already had its roots cut back, but apparently there are roots that are still growing and causing the ongoing problem. Besides the crack in the sidewalk, another part of the sidewalk is starting to raise Before someone trips and is hurt, the right thing to do to eliminate this problem is to remove the tree.  I did previously submit a written work order explaining all this and I handed it to the CD several months ago and twice came into the office to follow up. Was advised that it was one of several tree problems and that it would be addressed. In addition to the sidewalk damage, the driveway bricks are sinking. Thank you in advance for your attention to this issue.",

5/28/2025,WA68443,Sylvie Blum,Kristine Russo Diaz,open,On Hold,Landscaping,"I have submitted several work orders regarding a large tree on the swale in front of my home because it should have been removed when others were. The roots have spread into my lawn and will probably destroy my driveway which was  previously repaired after I sent more work  orders however the tree is continuing to spread out. I am surprised the gardeners can cut the grass. They didn’t spread mulch around it and every other tree on my street has mulch. What do I WANT? Removal of the tree and roots that are that are protruding or some other thing that can be done! In addition, when it is windy large branches, small ones and leaves are all over my lawn and down the street. Someone should come and look at it. Please have the tree removed!!",
